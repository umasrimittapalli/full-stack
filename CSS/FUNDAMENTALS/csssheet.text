Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it
indicated that the order of CSS rules matter.

.class
 #id
*
 element
 element, element
element element
element > element
element + element
: hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)

What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
 -Source Order
